# ECOD_manual_table
Repository for holding the list of ECOD manual representatives

This contains the manual representatives and a small subset of non-representative domains for ECOD, a protein domain dictionary.

Only X,H, and T- groups are described in this document, F-groups are determined wholly automatically.

Provisional manual domains (i.e. automatic manual representatives created to represent a new F-group) are not contained in this file

ECOD supports definition of both domain assemblies (i.e. multiple domains sharing a common core) and multi-chain domains (i.e. domains containing
multiple peptide chains due to proteolytic cleavage)
